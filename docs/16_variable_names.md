# Chapter 16 - Variable Names
time duration: 34:48 - 37:51  
- When writing Python code, it's important to use descriptive and meaningful variable names, like course_name instead of vague names like CN or C1. 
- Avoid "mystical" names that make the code hard to maintain and understand. 
- Short variable names like x, y, or z are only acceptable in specific contexts, such as math or coordinates. 
- Use lowercase letters consistently for variable names and seperate multiple words with underscores to improve readability. 
- Another best practice is to add spaces around the equal signs (=) when assigning values. Writing code without spaces looks messy and ugly. Your code should be clean and well formatted. 
- Autopep8 is the official style guide for python, promoting readability and consistent formatting.

``` python
students_count = 1000
rating = 4.99
is_published = True
course_name = "Python programming"
```
