# Chapter 21 - Numbers
time duration: 54:03 - 56:50  
There are three types of numbers in python.
1. Integers (x = 1)
2. Floats (x= 1.1)
3. Complex numbers (x = 1+2j)

For all these types of numbers, python have standard arithmetic operations that you have studied in maths. 
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

```python 
# 21_numbers.py
print(10+3)
print(10-3)
print(10*3)
print(10/3)
```
### Divisions are many types:
- If you use slash you get a floating point
- If you want an integer use double slashes
- If you want remainder use modulus 

```python
# 21_numbers.py
print(10//3)
print(10%3)
print(10**3)
```
** is used to get exponent.

- There is a special operator called augmented assignment operator 
```python
# 21_numbers.py
x = 10
x = x+3
or
x+=3 
```
Here addition is used in augmented operator. ANy operator can be used instead.
