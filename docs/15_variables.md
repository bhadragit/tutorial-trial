# Chapter 15 - Variables 
time duration: 31:44 - 34:48  
Variables is one of the core concepts in programming. Variables are used to store data in computer's memory.  
Example: 
```python
#15_variables.py
students_count = 1000
print(students_count)
```
When you run this code, python intepreter will allocate some memory and store this number. This variable is the reference to that memory location. Variable is like a label to that location. This label can be used anywhere in the program to get access to that memory location and the data stored.  

Now going to types of data, there are several kinds of data. In this chapter you are going to study built-in primitive types in Python. Primitive types can be numbers, booleans and strings

### Numbers
- Whole number is refered to as integers in programming language.
- Numbers with decimal points are called float.  
Example:
```python 
# 15_variables.py
rating = 4.99
```
### Booleans
- Boolean values can either be True or False  
Example:
```python
# 15_variables.py
is_published = True
```
#### Note:
Python is case sensitive language. i.e, Lowercase and Uppercase characters have different meanings. So boolean value should start with uppercase letter.
### String
Strings are basically text and you should use quotes while using texts as string in python.  
Example: 
```python
# 15_variables.py
course_name = "Python programming"
```
