# Chapter 11 - Python Implementations
Time duration: 24:30 - 26:59  
There are two topics covered in this chapter.
1. Language  
Defines a set of rules and grammar in writing code
2. Implementations  
Program that understand the code and can execute it.

When you run python in terminal , you get CPython. This is default implementation of python.  
Few other implementations are 
1. Jython - written in Java
2. Ironpython - Written in C#
3. PyPy - subset of python

Purpose of having different implementations is like you have different operating systems and browsers.  
Jython can be used if you want to import some java code into python program. Similarly other implementations also can be used.
