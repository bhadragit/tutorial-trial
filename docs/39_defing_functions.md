# Chapter 39 - Defining Functions
time duration: 1:45:13 - 1:47:37  
We have learned many built-in functions so far such as "print()", "round()" and so on.

Here you are going to learn to write your own functions.

The "def" function is used here.

Name your function meaningful, descriptive and use lowercase letters and an underscore to separate multiple words.

```python
# 39_defining_functions.py
def greet():
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")

greet()
```

Run this program and you will get these sentences as output.
